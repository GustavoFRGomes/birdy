This project will consist of a small application for the gathering and sentiment
analysis of social media posts, initially only for Twitter. The objective would
be to create a usable and simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Python and
Kivy to accomplish such tasks.

The Sentiment Analysis algorithms will be chosen in future commits. This
platform will be also making summarizations of texts inputed by the user.
